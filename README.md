# Another Rust Collada parser

This is a parser for the Collada (`.dae`) format, used for interchange between 3D renderers and games. Compared to the more mature [`collada`](https://crates.io/crates/collada) crate, this crate attempts to more directly represent the Collada data model, and it is also significantly more complete.

Currently it only supports reading, but writing is a planned addition.
